* This dataset was downloaded as (12) .csv files from [U.S. Public Assistance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jpmiller/publicassistance?select=WICAgencies2013ytd/).
* Link to [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k-hFV07D_SuZsrD7_QWKM_obHQNqOTFNqP9yojNhaQQ/edit?usp=sharing)  with all .csv files cleaned.
# Data Analysis
## Notes:
* Download the "Pregnant_Women_Participation", "Postpartum_Women_Participation", and "Total_Number_of_Participants" .csv files for the years (2013-2016). 
* There is a total of (12) .csv files that should be cleaned in OpenRefine. When cleaning, I only needed to sort the State agency/Tribal organization columb, remove a duplicate column with no data (which was an extra Texas), format columns with dates to a (00/00/00) style, and format the data to 'number' rather than 'plain text.'
* Upload the cleaned .csv files to Google Drive. 
* In Google Sheets, import each .csv file into three separate sheets (as tabs) ("Pregnant_Women_Participation", "Postpartum_Women_Participation", and "Total_Number_of_Participants") and group together the data based on year. There should be a color-coded system for each year in each sheet (e.g. green for 2013, purple for 2014, yellow for 2015, and blue for 2016). All years' data on annual participation are color-coded in pink.
* My data is limited to the years (2013-2016) because those were the only years the data is available. The time frame for each year begins on October 1st and ends on September 1st of the following year. 
- In other words, 'Average Participation 10/12-09/13' refers to the year 2013, 'Average Participation 10/13-09/14' refers to the year 2014, 'Average Participation 10/14-09/15' refers to the year 2015, and  'Average Participation 10/15-09/16' refers to the year 2016. For clarification purposes, the '00/00' format refers to month and year.
